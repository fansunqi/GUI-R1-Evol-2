## News
- [2025/05/04] We released an 800K high-quality reinforcement learning [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ritzzai/GUI-R1) filtered from the OS-Atlas pretraining data using QwenVL2.5-7B, with varying levels of difficulty. From this, we further filtered out a diverse subset of 10K samples and applied the DAPO algorithm, giving you the potential to outperform InfiGUI-R1. We warmly welcome everyone to utilize it!.
- [2025/04/18] We released the weights, code and scripts.
- [2025/04/17] We released [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ritzzai/GUI-R1)!
- [2025/04/14] Our GUI-R1 paper ([GUI-R1: A Generalist R1-style Vision-Language Action Model For GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10458)) can be accessed in arXiv!
- [2025/03/10] We start our project.

## Our Exploration

![](assets/exploration.jpg)

> By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to update the model, GUI-R1 achieves superior performance using only 0.02% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks. 

## Framework

![](assets/framework.jpg)

> Given the high-level instruction, action history, and visual image inputs, the policy model generates multiple responses containing reasoning steps. Then the verifiable rewards, such as action type reward, click point reward, and input text reward, are used with the policy gradient optimization algorithm to update the policy model.

## Requirements

We recommend using the [pre-built docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hiyouga/verl) in EasyR1.

```
# stable

docker pull hiyouga/verl:ngc-th2.5.1-cu120-vllm0.7.4-hotfix

# nightly

docker pull hiyouga/verl:ngc-th2.6.0-cu120-vllm0.8.2
```
